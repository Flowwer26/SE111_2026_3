    <My name is Saniyyah and I am an <b>Airforce Veteran</b>and was looking for data analysis and cybersecurity careers when I retired.After some research and the help of the liaisons at Veteran Affairs,I decided to enroll at NEIT for its <u>Cybersecurity</u> and Network program.Ive thought of a couple differnt job  options.I hope to land jobs as a Data Analyst working for non profits gathering user data for grants.A Cybersecurity job at the FBI or <i>CIA tracking threat groups</i>.Or reenlist with my Cyber degree and become an Officer in the Airforce.In my spare time I like to plant herbs for teas and fruit for plucking in my garden on my balcony.Spending time with my tuxedo kitten, whose barely a year old yet.But most of all, sewing, cutting, designing clothes and graphics for my brand I plan to launch.
