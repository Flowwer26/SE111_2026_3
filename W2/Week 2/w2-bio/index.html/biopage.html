            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <br>
            <p>While there are many things to say about me I have decided to choose just three.<b>I am creative in DIY projects, free willed in spaces  of nature, and rigorous in prblem solving.</b>I am from a big city of Boston and a small vast , Muslim diversed town of Dorchester in a community called Grove Hall. <i>vast</i> I grew up there for about <u>14 years</u> and moved to the South End.Lets just say I know my way around Boston, hahaha...<b>In 2016, I went on to college at SNHU and studied Computer Info Technology</b><b>In my freshman year I helped research and develop the MSA(muslim student association) club on campus by writing proposal to the <i>Dean of Students.</i><b>I later joined the military in 2018 as a Force Management Technician.</b><b>Whilst there I was promoted, recieved and given out awards and decorations, and changed history on my base.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>A little history on the town of Grove Hall!<b> Malcolm X migrated to Dorchester when he first entered Massaaschusetts, after Roxbury of course.</b><b> He spent much of his time in Grove Hall but mainly in place of worship on Intervale st, <i>Masjid Al Quran</i></b><b>I am born and raised in <i>Masjid Al Quran</i> and am Musilm. Dorchester is known  for its robust community arts, tasty old time and innovative food, and historic scenery. </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>I love a good DIY project or unconventional art or vintage piece in anyway.</b><b>I have a 1920 style microwave in my kitchen for the look of it!</b><b> I am working on building a flower wall installment for my  bedroom window.</b><b>I sometimes design back drops or prop furniture for photoshoots in my free time.</b><b>I love house decorating but professional styling as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I served as a Force Management Tech in the Airforce. <b>I was given Top Secret security clerance and overlooked, approved and entered new data, for base members and its commander.</b> I worked most days 16 hour shifts and was the youngest to join my department in my unit. I was given a chief coin for facilitating and part of a chief's retirement ceremony. <i>HOORAH!</i> I know my way around a map and an investigation. I wore many hats whilst as a Force Man. Tech, but gained so many skills and knowledge to succeed! In not just my career but other careers as well.</p>
